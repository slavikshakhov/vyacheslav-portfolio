The latter is either added to or subtracted from the total balance. I used my custom animations to show the magic. If the user wishes to view the transactions for a certain day, he or she may click on a selected day in a calendar. I built the calendar from scratch just using the Javascript Date object. I used React Context API to manage the global state and React Hooks for a local state management.",
