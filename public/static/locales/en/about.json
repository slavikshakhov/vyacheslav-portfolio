    "body": "I build complex responsive full stack web applications primarily in React, Angular and Node.js, All my projects utilize the most advanced technologies. I feel comfortable to work with css, sass, bootstrap, tailwind and material design on the front end. Many of my projects require user registration and authentication, where security is my first prioriy. When I work with React, I use the most updated version of the framework, using React Hooks and Context API or Redux for global state management. I am proficient in Javascript, comfortably working both with standard Javascript and ES6. My deep knowledge of algorithms and data structures helps me to write the most efficient code.",
