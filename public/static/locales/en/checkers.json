    "description": "This React application is a classic checkers game. Each move is recorded in the summery table with a move from / to location, type of piece moved and whether it resulted in a capture of an opponent piece. Each cell of the board is actually a React component. Since the game requires complex data sharing between multiple components, I used Redux rather than React Context.",
